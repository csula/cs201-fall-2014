<h1>CS201: Introduction to Programming</h1>

<p>This is an individual exam, therefore no collaboration.  If you are caught cheating, <strong>you will receive an F for the course</strong>. This is NOT negotiable.</p>

<h2>Quiz 3</h2>

You may refer to your notes, the class website, and your textbook.  However, you are not allowed to search the Internet for an answer, nor are you permitted to discuss the exam with anyone else through email, instant messengers, or any other means.</pre>

<h3>Question 1</h3>

<p>You only need to do one of two programs: (1) Write a GUI program that simulates a telephone dial pad. (2) Write a program that two buttons: <b>east</b> and <b>west</b>.  When the east button is pressed, the system prints out "east" and the west button is pressed, then system prints out "west"</p>

<h3>Question 2</h3>

<p>Consider <a href="https://github.com/csula/cs201-fall-2014/tree/master/src/lab14">Lab 14</a>.  Your assignment is to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a text field: used to specify the number of circles to be generated</li>
  <li>Add a "green" button: when pressed it will now generate green circle(s)</li>
  <li>Add a "random color" button: when pressed it will generate for each circle one of the following colors randomly: red, green, blue, black</li>
</ul>

<p>The program now works as followed, depending on the value of the text field, whenever a button is pressed that will be the number of circles to be generated.</p>
