<h1>CS201: Introduction to Programming</h1>

<p>This is an individual exam, therefore no collaboration.  If you are caught cheating, <strong>you will receive an F for the course</strong>. This is NOT negotiable.</p>

<p>Let us assume that we have an array of strings as followed:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
String[] k = {
  "zero",
  "one",
  "two", 
  "three",
  "four",
  "five",
  "six",
  "seven",
  "eight",
  "nine",
};
</pre></div>

<p>The following programs must use above variable <strong>k</strong>.</p>

<p>Write a program that prints out all the odd numbers between 1 and 9. So your program should print out the following:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
one
three
five
seven
nine
</pre></div>

<p>Write a program that prints out the numbers whose first letter is a vowel.  So your program should print out the following:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
one
eight
</pre></div>

<p><strong>Submission:</strong>: You must submit only two files: <strong>CountProgram.java</strong> and <strong>quiz1.jar</strong>.  <em>You will not receive any credit if you do not upload the source code.</em>  Make sure that your program can be easily executed as followed:</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
java -jar quiz1.jar
</pre></div>
